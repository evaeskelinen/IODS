#Assignment 2  Eva Eskelinen, 12.11.2022 
# Reading the full data from learning2014 was a struggle and I'm still not sure if I did it correctly
# to read the data use: lrn <- read.table("https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-data.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
# I am not quite sure what the purpose of 'sep\t", header=TRUE' is in this function, but I guess it will be clearer at some point. This formula was from the exercise 2 sheet.
