# Regression and model validation

In this section the walk through of the Exercise sheet 2 will be given as well as the actual Assignment 2. 

- The work sheet has been a struggle, first to open on R Studio and then to complete the exercises. 
- All learnt the previous week has been forgotten. Or so it seems.
- Some key elements need to be relearned because this is a real struggle and half the time I have no idea where I'm going wrong or what I am doing.

```{r}
# You can skip this part, this is just notes on the Excercise". 
# Read the data into R studio. Use lrn14 <- read.table("website", sep="\t", header=TRUE), use 'dim()' to look at dimension, 'str()' to look at structure
#2.2 Scaling variables 
#Use the '#' to write intended action then on the next row add the command with no #, eg. c(1,2,3,4,5) /2 if you want to divide each number in a vector, to create the new column with the data achieved, use lrn14$attitude <- lrn14$Attitude / 10 where 'lrn14$attitude' is the new wanted column and '<- lrn14$Attitude / 10' is the data wanted in it.
# To assign variables to a column use 'name of column <--c("X","Y",...)'
# to print the data: data name$column name aka lrn14$Attitude
# 2.3 Combining variables
# Useful commands function      | description
# ------------- | ----------
# `colSums(df)` | returns a sum of each column in `df`
# `rowSums(df)` | returns a sum of each row in `df`
# `colMeans(df)`| returns the mean of each column in `df`
# `rowMeans(df)`| return the mean of each row in `df`
# 2.4 Selecting columns, 
# Assign the columns with c(), then to create a newdataset name <- select(dataset that has the info, one_of(selected columns))
# 2.5 Modifying column names, to print out column names use 'colnames(name of dataset), to modify, just add [X] where X is the number of column and <- "Y" where Y is the new name of the column
# 2.6 Excluding observations -> go to library dplyr, create object 'male_students' by selecting males from 'learning2014' --> this is done by 'name of wanted object' <- filter(dataset, 'what is wanted'+ assigned value <, ==, >) eg.male_students <- filter(learning2014, gender == "M"), then rows where points is greater than zero are wanted > learning2014 <- filter(male_students, points > "0")
# 2.7 Visualization with ggplot2 
# plots may be created via the convenience function 'gplot()'
# Create graphics with ggplot2: start by using library ggplot2 and creating the plot, in this case p1. Add data and aesthetic mapping by p1 <- ggplot('dataset', aes(x = value, y= value))
# To define visualization type, in here 'points' use p2 <- p1 + geom_point() <-- you can find these on the cheatsheet, also when adding something increase the number in pX. Add a regression line p3 <- p2 + geom_smooth(method = "1m"), change title by p4 <- p3 + ggtitle("title wanted here") DO NOT foRGET p3 + !!!
# 2.8 Exploring a data frame: to visualize several plots in one scatter plot matrix: pairs(dataset), if you want to exclude something use [-X], where X is the column, in this case, gender since it doesn't have a numeric value. To adjust the visuals (remember to access ggpot2 and GGally libraries first) add the argument col = gender to the code inside of aes(), p <- ggpairs(learning2014, aes(col = gender, alpha = 0.3)), to adjust transparency of the colors add aplha = 'a value' so that the two color mappings can be seen over each other. 
# 2.9 Simple regression, '1m()' function to fit a linear model, first argument is 'formula', this defines the target variable and the explanatory variable(s). Use formula 'y ~ x' where 'y' is the target/outcome, 'x' the explanatory variable/predictor. To print out a summary of the model, use summary()
# 'points' vs. 'attitude' --> gplot(attitude, points, data = learning2014) + geom_smooth(method = "lm") where the function gplot() creates the plot, attitude and points are the values wanted, and the reside in the dataset 'learning2014'. To add the a linear model use '1m'. Put this into '+ geom_smooth(method = "1m") which adds a regression line.
# fit a linear model
# my_model <- lm(points ~ 1, data = learning2014)
# 2.10 Multiple regression: To add more explanatory variables simple define them in the 'formula' argument of '1m()' 
# eg. y ~ x1 + x2 ..
# 2.11 Graphical model validation 
# which | graphic                                 
# ----- | --------
# 1     | Residuals vs Fitted values 
# 2     | Normal QQ-plot
# 3     | Standardized residuals vs Fitted values
# 4     | Cook's distances
# 5     | Residuals vs Leverage 
# 6     | Cook's distance vs Leverage 
# library(ggplot2)
# > my_model2 <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra, data = learning2014)
# > par(mfrow = c(2,2))
# > plot(my_model2, which = c(1,2,5))
# 2.12 Making predictions, use 'predict()' see ? predict
#  The first argument of predict is a model object and the argument `newdata` (a data.frame) can be used to make predictions based on new observations. One or more columns of `newdata` should have the same name as the explanatory variables in the model object."

So I've been going trough the Exercise2 sheet and so far have learned nothing...my own fault I assume. I understand what's going on when I see the commands used but cannot duplicate the formula/function by myself with just instructions. 
A very useful website so far: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

The following is the process used to do the Assignment and some analysis of it.

1. Reading the data into R Studio
lrn <- read.table("https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-data.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
2. Installing possible libraries that might be used
- As I wasn't sure which ones would be necessary, all 4 were recalled from the library for use. Out of these mainly dplyrt and tidyverse were used.

>library(GGally)
>library(ggplot2)
>library(dplyr)
>library(tidyverse)

3. Combining questions of the data: Deep, surface and strategic questions
- For this section the data was cleaned up for later use. Data relater to deep questions were combined to be found under the label 'deep_questions' and the same process was done for surface and strategic questions with the function shown below. 'deep_questions was to be the assigned name for the combination of variables selected done by the <- assign function followed by the c() function including the selected columns.

> deep_questions <- c("D03", "D11", "D19", "D27", "D07", "D14", "D22", "D30","D06",  "D15", "D23", "D31")
> surface_questions <- c("SU02","SU10","SU18","SU26", "SU05","SU13","SU21","SU29","SU08","SU16","SU24","SU32")
> strategic_questions <- c("ST01","ST09","ST17","ST25","ST04","ST12","ST20","ST28")

4.  Selecting columns related to deep learning, surface learning and strategic learning
- in this part with the assigning and select functions we have selected columns wanted from the 'lrn' dataset

> deep_columns <- select(lrn, one_of(deep_questions))
> lrn$deep <- rowMeans(deep_columns)
>  surface_columns <- select(lrn, one_of(surface_questions))
>  lrn$surf <- rowMeans(surface_columns)
>  strategic_columns <- select(lrn, one_of(strategic_questions))
>  lrn$stra <- rowMeans(strategic_columns)

5. Combining wanted variables into one and renaming it
- Now that the variables deep, stra and surf have been defined as wanted, they and the rest of the wanted variables are combined. Please ignore the name change at this points, this was more for myself than anything else.
> keep_columns2 <- c( "gender", "Age", "Attitude", "deep", "stra", "surf", "Points")
> learning2015 <- keep_columns2

6. Selecting wanted columns
- Next we selected the columns wanted in our dataset excluding the exam points variables where it is zero.
> learning2015 <- select(lrn, one_of(keep_columns2))
> points <- filter(learning2015, Points > "0" )
> learning2015 <- points

7. Checking the dimension of the dataset
- This was used to see if the numbers correspond to the wanted number.
>dim(learning2015)
    [1] 166  7
    
8. Saving the data (Is there really no easier way?)
- The write_csv function was used for this, however the only reason why I have managed to do this is thanks to another student asking about it and putting a screenshot. So I have no idea how to do this easier....
>write_csv("/Users/evaeskelinen/Documents/GitHub/IODS/data/learning2015.csv")

9. Reading data
> read_csv("/Users/evaeskelinen/Documents/GitHub/IODS/data/learning2015.csv")

    # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
    
10. Making sure the structure is correct
> str("/Users/evaeskelinen/Documents/GitHub/IODS/data/learning2015.csv")
> chr "/Users/evaeskelinen/Documents/GitHub/IODS/data/learning2015.csv"
> head("/Users/evaeskelinen/Documents/GitHub/IODS/data/learning2015.csv")
[1] "/Users/evaeskelinen/Documents/GitHub/IODS/data/learning2015.csv"
