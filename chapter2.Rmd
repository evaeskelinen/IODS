# Regression and model validation

In this section the walk through of the Exercise sheet 2 will be given. 

- The work sheet has been a struggle, first to open on R Studio and then to complete the exercises. 
- All learnt the previous week has been forgotten. Or so it seems.
- Some key elements need to be relearned because this is a real struggle and half the time I have no idea where I'm going wrong or what I am doing.

So I've been going trough the Exercise2 sheet and so far have learned nothing...my own fault I assume. I understand what's going on when I see the commands used but cannot duplicate the formula/function by myself with just instructions.
